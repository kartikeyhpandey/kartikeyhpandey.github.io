                    <p>I am driven by my passionate beliefs in growth, family, and responsibility. I pursue these passions by utilizing my core strengths of competition, empathy, and intellection. I plan to live out these values through opportunities where I am creating and learning to achieve happiness and innovation that impacts technologies and communities. To do so, I will seek opportunities to develop new technologies and make idea-driven changes. When I face challenges or obstacles along the way, I will remember to find opportunities for self-discovery and make decisive actions.</p>

                        To me, a global citizen scholar is a person who strives to learn about the various issues that affect their community and who tries to assist those affected by these issues in addition to attempting to find solutions to them. I want to become a global citizen scholar because I want to bring about a change in the world around me. In order to achieve my Global Scholar Mission, the first step would be to utilize each and every opportunity appearing in front of me as a student at the University of Cincinnati. I plan on doing this by first taking courses provided by the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science to learn more about developing technology and different types of technology that are affecting the world around us today. I also plan on participating in various programs provided through Honors such as UHP Ignite to further help me achieve my goal of helping the community around me, as well as help me grow as an individual.

                        I have been doing regular community service for years now and I have to admit that volunteering gives me the most happiness as well as a sense of inner peace. I plan to continue this venture of participating in various volunteer services and helping the community around me in the next few years. This year, I was involved in volunteering with Upward Bound Tutoring Services, where I helped high-school students with their school work and various other things that would assist them with preparing for college, such as ACT/SAT help. I really enjoyed this experience and at the end of every two-hour session, I left with a big smile and feeling of satisfaction. In the coming years, I plan to continue participating in various volunteer activities like this and trying to help those in the community around me.

                        I am a member of a student organization called UC CubeCats, it aims to be the center of research and development in the space industry for university students. This year we worked on developing a high-altitude-balloon payload mission which was aimed at studying the muon events at different altitudes. I was the software and payload team lead for this mission and I truly loved the work I did and every moment was enjoyable. For the next year, I am going to work in power systems for project LEOPARD, an educational CubeSat mission set to be launched in 2020 by NASA. LEOPARD, an acronym for Low-Earth Orbit Platform for Aerospace Research and Development, will use sensors to test whether carbon composite can shield deadly radiation in space. It’s a serious concern for NASA, which has devoted an entire working group at the Johnson Space Center to studying space radiation. I am excited to have the opportunity to work on something that many students never have the chance to do. To be working on a project which NASA will launch into space is something that is absolutely invaluable to me, and to be able to work on this project next year renders me truly speechless, and I am genuinely very excited to be a part of this organization and to have a hand in developing this satellite which will help solve more than just the problems in Ohio, but also those regarding future space travel. To have this impact on the world around me is the most amazing thing I have done so far, and I hope to continue working on such projects in the future.

                        Throughout my years in school, I have had many experiences where I have attempted to solve some of the issues faced by the people around me, and these are some of my most cherished experiences. When I came to UC my goal was to develop myself as a global citizen and to use the education that I receive here to fulfill my goal of becoming a social entrepreneur, and better the world around me. In the future, I intend to expand my knowledge and widen my perspective so that I can use this education as a tool to solve the prominent issues of the world and ultimately achieve my Global Scholar Mission.
